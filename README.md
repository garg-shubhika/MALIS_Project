You live far from EURECOM and want to fly home for the holidays. The problem is… you never know when to book to get the cheapest plane ticket. We intend to provide a solution for you through an application of machine learning. 

It is a well-known fact that airlines use dynamic pricing and change ticket prices depending on several factors. In this project, we will attempt to build a model apt to predict flight prices by taking into account the number of days left until the flight. Thus, you will be able to fly home without breaking the bank.
